- bisect.c
    - C implementation of the Bisection Method for finding the root of a polynomial.
    - TODO : doesn't seem to handle negative roots yet.
    
- bisect_test.c
    - Tests accuracy and also benchmarks the bisect() method from bisect.c. 
    - RESULTS: 
        - Tested with (f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x - 2), e = 10^-6, on interval [1,3]
        - Converged to 2.000015 (real valued root is 2) in 0.00000185566 seconds
