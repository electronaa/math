## Numerical Analysis

- **bisect.c**
    - C implementation of the Bisection Method for finding root(s) of a polynomial.
    - TODO : doesn't seem to handle negative roots yet.

- **secm.c**
    - C implementation of the Secant Method for finding root(s) of a polynomial.
    - MUCH faster and more precise than bisect()
    
- **bisect_test.c**
    - Tests accuracy and also benchmarks the bisect() and secm() functions.
    - Tested with f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x - 1), on interval [1,2]
